# Spearmint

## What is it

Spearmint is a statically typed, simple language that is strongly inspired by TypeScript and Rust. It is primarily object oriented but has some functional goodies such as pattern matching thrown in.

The focus of Spearmint is to make it easy to write safe code that follows good coding practices and patterns.

## Current status

Currently, Spearmint is still in the design phase. The language overview and specification are still being written and refined.

Once the specification is at a satisfactory stage, a Spearmint compiler will be written using TypeScript. Eventually, Spearmint will be self-hosting.
